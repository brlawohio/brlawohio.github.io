			<p class="lead">“What motivates me? I love to figure things out, to sink my teeth into a challenge and know that no problem will defeat me. It’s why I love being an attorney. Every day is a new challenge, a new problem just waiting for me to get to the solution. Taking that solution to court and coming out on top, to my clients’ benefit, is what drives me.” </p>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p class="lead text-primary">I’m a Clevelander, not by birth but by choice</p>
		<p>Growing up in rural Michigan, Joseph Baker loved running and solving riddles but wasn’t too sure about life in a rural town. He kept looking for a place that suited his personality and desire to make an impact. When he moved to Northeast Ohio after earning a Bachelor’s degree in political science and government, he found his niche, both in the thriving Cleveland community and in the law. The practice of law gives Mr. Baker the opportunity to learn new things every day and use that knowledge to solve real-life riddles for people in need.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Juris Doctor, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, 2000</li>
			<li>Bachelor of Science, Political Science, Northern Michigan University, 1996</li>

		<h3>Experience Highlights</h3>

		<p>Mr. Baker is entering his 15th year of practice as a litigator. His early years were focused on general litigation for both plaintiffs and defendants in all aspects of the law ranging, from plaintiff products liability claims to defense of broker/dealers securities litigation and business litigation with previous firms, Janik & Dorman, LLP. and Wulliger, Fadel & Beyer, LLC.  During this time, Mr. Baker also defended individuals charged with white-collar criminal defense.  The last nine years, as an attorney and later as a partner with Giffen & Kaminski, LLC. have added additional litigation matters to his experience, including employment litigation, banking and commercial litigation, and further expansion of his white-collar criminal defense practice.</p>
		
		<p>A well-respected litigator with an incisive legal mind, Mr. Baker brings a nuanced understanding to complex legal issues. It is this, along with his insider’s experience, which has led him to an impressive record of successes, both in the courtroom and in arbitration forums.</p>
